1. Please enter the team members here

2. Don't forget to define milestones and outline them in GitHub, see: https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/creating-and-editing-milestones-for-issues-and-pull-requests

3. Each group member must state which part of the work (not only documentation and/or presentation) he/she has created. (e.g., push to github)

4. At least one update per week is required from each group member

5. The project documentation must be described in a way that would enable other future processors to continue working on the project. For this purpose, use the possibilities of descriptions with pictures, diagrams (e.g. UML, flowcharts, sequence diagrams, ...) and tables. In addition, be sure to describe in the project documentation how your software should be operated.

6. Your presentation should be max. 10 - 15 minutes. You should briefly explain how and why you implemented the project the way you did, e.g. architecture, class diagram, etc. You might also answer questions like the following:
- What difficulties did you encounter?
- What could be done better?
- What would you perhaps change or improve about the architecture?

7. Please do not forget to upload the slides of your presentation here

8. Topic of the project: Creation of an application for the exchange of messages, files and images, similar to WhatsApp, Discord or Slack

9. In the source folder you will find Java classes that you need to use in your project for implementation
